## 📌 Project Title

**Console-Based Food Ordering System using Java**

---

## 📖 Project Description

This project is a **console-based Food Ordering System** developed in **Java** as a **Semester 1 Group Project**.
The application simulates a simple restaurant or food counter ordering process where users can view available food items, select items, place orders, and calculate the total bill.

The main objective of this project is to apply **core Java programming concepts** learned in the first semester and understand how a real-world ordering system works at a basic level using a command-line interface.
